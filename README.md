#Java DS Practice

This repo contains a few medium/hard LeetCode problems that I solved to improve my understanding of core data structures in Java.

Problems included:

LRU Cache
Uses HashMap + Doubly Linked List to achieve O(1) operations.

Top K Frequent Elements
Uses HashMap for counting and PriorityQueue (min heap) for selecting top elements.

Merge K Sorted Lists
Uses a PriorityQueue to efficiently merge multiple sorted linked lists.

Group Anagrams
Uses HashMap and sorted string keys to group similar words.
